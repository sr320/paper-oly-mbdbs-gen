### _Ostrea lurida_ Genome feature files 

These are copy of feature files associated with the draft Ostrea lurida genome, and were used to characterize the genome and identify where loci of interest (e.g. methylated loci) are in the genome. Most of the feature files, which were originally generated by the Roberts Lab, are also available on the Roberts Lab website under [Genomic Resources](https://robertslab.github.io/resources/Genomic-Resources/#ostrea-lurida). The remainder of the feature files were generated by Laura Spencer or Katherine Silliman for this project - see the notebooks [02-Generating-meth-feature-files](https://github.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen/blob/master/code/02-Generating-meth-feature-files.Rmd) and 
[06-Meth-Pst-bins.Rmd](https://github.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen/blob/master/code/06-Meth-Pst-bins.Rmd).
