#### Load libraries 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE}
list.of.packages <- c("methylKit") #add new libraries here 
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)

# Load all libraries 
lapply(list.of.packages, FUN = function(X) {
  do.call("require", list(X))

```

## Generate count files for analysis in MACAU 

MACAU is a software program that assess the influence of a variable (or covariates) on differential methylation while controlling for relatedness. In our case, we will look at the influence of oyster length & wet weight on DML, while considering relatedness in the  Hood Canal and South Sound Olympia oyster populations. Inputs required for MACAU include: 

  1) Total read counts
  2) Methylated read counts 
  3) Relatedness file 
  4) Variable of interest 
  
In  this notebook I will generate #1 and  #2 - the count files - from a methylKit object. 

First, load object that Steven created in 01-methylkit.Rmd 

```{r}
load("../analyses/myobj_18")
```

"The following function will merge all samples to one object for base-pair locations that are covered in all samples. Setting destrand=TRUE (the default is FALSE) will merge reads on both strands of a CpG dinucleotide. This provides better coverage, but only advised when looking at CpG methylation (for CpH methylation this will cause wrong results in subsequent analyses). In addition, setting destrand=TRUE will only work when operating on base-pair resolution, otherwise setting this option TRUE will have no effect. The unite() function will return a methylBase object which will be our main object for all comparative analysis. The methylBase object contains methylation information for regions/bases that are covered in all samples."

```{r}
meth.stranded <- unite(myobj_18, destrand=FALSE)
meth.destrand <- unite(myobj_18, destrand=TRUE)
```

Let's take a peek at the object where I retain strandedness 

```{r}
head(meth.stranded)
tail(meth.stranded)
```

Now the object where reads on both strands are merged - should increase coverage 

```{r}
head(meth.destrand)
tail(meth.destrand)
```

When I look at the last 6  base pairs using tail() I see that, indeed, coverage increases when I remove strandedness. I'll create 2 sets of read files - stranded, and destranded. 

From one of the objects, e.g. `head(meth.stranded)`, we can orient ourselves to this type of object's format. We have base-pair resolution of coverage, number of C's (aka methylated C's), and number of T's (aka unmethylated C's, which were coverted upon bisulfite treatment), for each sample from 1 through 18. The "coverage" value is the same as the sum of C's and T's, so this is our "total read counts" value.

#### Generate raw count data  files 

Let's start with the stranded data. 

Create subset-able dataframe from methylkit object. 

```{r}
meth.stranded.df <- getData(meth.stranded)
```

Create a new, single column with a base site ID by merging contig, start, and strand info. 

```{r}
meth.stranded.df$siteID <- with(meth.stranded.df, paste0(chr, start, strand))  #merge id columns into 1
ncol(meth.stranded.df) #count total #  columns 
meth.stranded.df <- subset(meth.stranded.df, select=c(59,1:58)) #move siteID to first  column
head(meth.stranded.df) #check resulting dataframe 
```

Create dataframe with total counts (aka coverage), and location info (chromosome, start, strand). End was not pulled, since count are of single base pairs (start and end are the same)

```{r}
counts.tot.stranded <- meth.stranded.df[, grep(c("siteID|coverage"), colnames(meth.stranded.df))]
```

Create dataframe with methylated counts  

```{r}
counts.meth.stranded <- meth.stranded.df[, grep(c("siteID|numCs"), colnames(meth.stranded.df))]
```

#### Repeat the above with destranded data 

```{r}
meth.destranded.df <- getData(meth.destrand)
meth.destranded.df$siteID <- with(meth.destranded.df, paste0(chr, start))  #merge id columns into 1
ncol(meth.destranded.df) #count total #  columns 
meth.destranded.df <- subset(meth.destranded.df, select=c(59,1:58)) #move siteID to first  column
head(meth.destranded.df) #check resulting dataframe 
counts.tot.destrand <- meth.destranded.df[, grep(c("siteID|coverage"), colnames(meth.destranded.df))]
counts.meth.destrand <- meth.destranded.df[, grep(c("siteID|numCs"), colnames(meth.destranded.df))]
```

Inspect count dataframes  

```{r}
head(counts.tot.stranded)
head(counts.meth.stranded)
head(counts.tot.destrand)
head(counts.meth.destrand)
```

#   START HERE 

Filter count dataframes for 

```{r}
counts.tot.destrand.10x <- counts.tot.destrand %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(contains('coverage')), funs(ifelse(. < 10, NA, .)))
require(dplyr)
counts.tot.destrand[!rowSums(is.na(counts.tot.destrand)) > 0.25*18,]
```



Write dataframes to tab delimited .txt files for MACAU. 

```{r}
write.table(counts.tot.stranded, file = "../analyses/counts-total-stranded.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE,  quote = FALSE)
write.table(counts.meth.stranded, file = "../analyses/counts-meth-stranded.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE,  quote = FALSE)
write.table(counts.tot.destrand, file = "../analyses/counts-total-destrand.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE,  quote = FALSE)
write.table(counts.meth.destrand, file = "../analyses/counts-meth-destrand.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE,  quote = FALSE)
```

Write out dataframe with merged  ID, contig #, start #, and strand info for later use 

```{r}
write.table(meth.destranded.df, file = "../analyses/meth.destranded.df.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE,  quote = FALSE)
write.table(meth.stranded.df, file = "../analyses/meth.stranded.df.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE,  quote = FALSE)
```


### Prepare other files for MACAU

I need the predictor variable and  relatedness matrix to be in the same order as the count files.  
Read in size data (predictor variable), and sample ID key. 
```{r}
print(size <- read.csv(file = "../data/mbd_size.csv", header=T, sep = "\t"))
print(key <- read.csv("../data/sample-key.csv"))
```

Merge size and sample key, making sure that the size data is ordered from sample #1 to #18. Include a  column of 1's - these are needed for the MACAU covariate file as it's used as the intercept. 
```{r}
print(size.macau <- cbind(x=c(rep(1,times=18)), y=merge(y=size, x=key, by.y="Sample", by.x="SAMPLE")))
```

Save 3 text files for MACAU. Don't include rownames or column names.  
- predictors.size.macau.txt: contains both weight and length measurements so I can use either in MACAU as predictor. 
- cov.weight.macau.txt: contains column of 1's (intercept) and weights to use as covariate (when length is predictor).  
- cov.length.macau.txt: contains column of 1's (intercept) and lengths to use as covariate (when weight is predictor).  

```{r}
write.table(size.macau[c(4:5)],  file="../data/predictors.size.macau.txt", sep="\t", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
write.table(size.macau[c(1,4)],  file="../data/cov.weight.macau.txt", sep="\t", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
write.table(size.macau[c(1,5)],  file="../data/cov.length.macau.txt", sep="\t", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```
